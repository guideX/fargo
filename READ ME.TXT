[ Fargo 0.11 ]

Fixed missing cls file
Fargo is an alpha development environment. Incomplete with an IDE, interpreter, objects, and the ability to compile to exe.

Note: If you fail to setup this program it will not function at all

Step 1: Download http://www.tnexgen.com/downloads/NexgenTab.ocx to <location of Fargo>\IDE\
Step 2: Click start menu, run 'regsvr32 <location of fargo>\IDE\NexgenTab.ocx'
Step 3: Compile \INTERPRETER\NVCDI.vbp to \IDE\DATA\BIN\NVCDI.EXE
Step 4: Open \IDE\DATA\BIN\paths.ini with notepad and follow the steps in that file.
Step 5: Copy \IDE\DATA\BIN\paths.ini to \INTERPRETER\

And your ready to run the IDE\Visual Code Designer.vbp and compile exe's of your own. Good luck.

Some of the buttons and controls used in the ide were downloaded from www.planet-source-code.com and altered. Thanks to developers who are not yet mentioned.
